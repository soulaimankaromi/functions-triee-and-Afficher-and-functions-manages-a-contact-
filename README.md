WordPositionSeparator
The program captures user input for a word and organizes its characters into two strings: 'motp' for even positions and 'moti' for odd positions. Through iteration, each character's position is determined and appended to the respective string. The output visually displays characters at even and odd positions.


ContactManager
This program manages a contact file ('contact.txt') by adding details through the 'Add' function, including first and last name, telephone number, and type. The 'supprimer' function filters out 'personnel' contacts, updating the file with the retained entries. This script efficiently handles contact addition and removal based on specific criteria.
